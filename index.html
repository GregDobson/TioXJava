<h1>Tiox</h1>
<p>Many concepts in operations management require one to visualize how a system will behave over time.  It can be challenging to imagine such systems especially when there is variability or randomness in the arrival pattern of customers or the service times to handle customers.  These animations, TIOX (“Time Is On the X-axis”) are designed as a bridge to allow a student new to operations to observe a process and understand why customers wait for service or customers are left unsatisfied by a retail (inventory) process. One can, depending on the animation, see the performance, say wait, of individual customers, of averages of customers, and theoretical long term averages of customers.</p>
